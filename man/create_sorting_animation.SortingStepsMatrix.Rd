\title{Create Sorting Animation for SortingStepsMatrix}
\usage{
\method{create_sorting_animation}{SortingStepsMatrix}(sorting_steps_df)
}
\arguments{
\item{sorting_steps_df}{A data frame or matrix of class \code{SortingStepsMatrix},
typically representing the steps in a sorting algorithm. Each row should
represent a step, and each column a different element being sorted.}
}
\value{
An animation object created by \code{gganimate}, visualizing the sorting steps.
The animation can be played in R's viewer pane or saved as a GIF or video file.
}
\description{
This function takes a \code{SortingStepsMatrix} object, which typically represents
the steps involved in a sorting algorithm, and creates an animated visualization
using \code{ggplot2} and \code{gganimate}. The animation shows the progression of the
sorting process step by step.
