\title{Insertion Sort with Step-by-Step Tracking}
\usage{
insertion_sort_steps(N)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{An integer specifying the number of elements in the sequence to be sorted.
The sequence is generated as a random permutation of integers from 1 to N.}
}
\value{
A matrix where each row represents the state of the sequence at each step of the sorting process.
The first row is the initial, unsorted sequence, and subsequent rows show the sequence after each movement in the insertion sort algorithm.
If N is 1, a single-row matrix with the unsorted sequence is returned, as no sorting is needed.
}
\description{
Performs an insertion sort on a randomly generated sequence of integers, recording each sorting step.
}
\examples{
insertion_sort_steps(5)  # Sorts a sequence of 5 elements
insertion_sort_steps(1)  # Returns the unsorted single-element sequence

}
