\title{Bubble Sort with Step-by-Step Tracking}
\usage{
bubble_sort_steps(N)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{Integer for the number of elements to sort. The function creates a random sequence from 1 to N.}
}
\value{
A matrix where each row shows the sequence at a particular step of sorting.
The first row is the original sequence, and subsequent rows show the sequence after each swap.
If N is 1, returns the original single element as no sorting is needed.
}
\description{
Performs a bubble sort on a random sequence of integers, recording each sorting step.
}
\examples{
bubble_sort_steps(5)  # Sorts a sequence of 5 elements
bubble_sort_steps(1)  # Returns a single-element sequence

}
